        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p>
            We are a youth-led AI EdTech project dedicated to providing high-quality educational
            resources to girls in Afghanistan. Using interactive video lessons, AI-powered learning
            tools, and personalized assignments, we aim to make learning accessible, engaging,
            and impactful.
        </p>
        <p>
            We strive to empower students through technology, inspire lifelong learning, and create
            opportunities for girls to reach their full potential.
        </p>
        <p>
            We welcome collaboration with partners, NGOs, and investors to expand our reach and impact.
            If you are a student, educator, or supporter, you can join us and access our programs by
            submitting an application.

    <div class="about-block about-problems">
        <h3>The problems we solve</h3>
        <p>
            Many girls in Afghanistan face barriers to quality education due to limited access,
            social restrictions, and lack of interactive learning tools. We aim to bridge this gap
            by offering video lessons, interactive exercises, and educational games that students
            can access safely from home.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="about-block about-ai">
        <h3>Why AI</h3>
        <p>
            Artificial Intelligence allows us to personalize learning for each student, track progress,
            provide instant feedback, and create engaging, adaptive educational experiences.
            AI helps us scale our impact efficiently, reaching more students with high-quality learning
            tailored to their needs.
